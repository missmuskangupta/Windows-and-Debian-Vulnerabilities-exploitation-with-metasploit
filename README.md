# Windows-and-Debian-Vulnerabilities-exploitation-with-metasploit
The project involved conducting targeted vulnerability assessments on both Windows and Debian systems, followed by exploiting identified vulnerabilities using the Metasploit Framework. Through systematic penetration testing, critical security weaknesses were identified and leveraged to simulate real-world cyber threats. This comprehensive approach enabled the team to gain valuable insights into system vulnerabilities and develop proactive defense strategies to mitigate potential risks. 
                 The tools required in this project are:-
● Kali Linux - Kali Linux is Debian based, previously known as Backtrack, is a widely used Linux distribution used for penetration testing and security auditing,which has more than 600 pre-installed tools for "pen-testing, Computer forensics,Reverse Engineering, and security cookbook." Offensive Security develops it.Offensive Security also has offers the industry's most recognized certification for penetration testing, known as OSCP.
● MSFconsole - MSFconsole is by far the most popular part of the Metasploit Framework, and for good reason. It is one of the most flexible, feature-rich, and well supported tools within the Framework. MSFconsole provides a handy all-in-one interface to almost every option and setting available in the Framework; it’s like a
one-stop shop for all of your exploitation dreams. You can use MSFconsole to do everything, including launching an exploit, loading auxiliary modules, performing
enumeration, creating listeners, or running mass exploitation against an entire network.
● Metasploit - Metasploit is a pen-testing framework that is put in use to test security vulnerabilities, enumerate networks, and evade detection, just like all the
phases of penetration testing combined, instead of using multiple tools. It is a single environment for penetration testing and exploits development. This tool is
pre-installed in Kali Linux.
● Nmap - Nmap is a network scanner that looks for available target hosts via network discovery. It detects security risks by finding the systems in the network,
their open ports, services running on those open ports, and scanning forvulnerabilities.
● Hydra - Hydra is a pre-built tool in kali used to crack passwords by brute-forceand attack different protocols.
● Nessus - Nessus is one of the most advanced and widely used vulnerability scanners. It scans the target for the vulnerabilities and provides detailed information
such as CVE details and the vulnerability's risk factor and criticality. 
●Payload - A payload is code that we want the system to execute and that is to be selected and delivered by the Framework.
