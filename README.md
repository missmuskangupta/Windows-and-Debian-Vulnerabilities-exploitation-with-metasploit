# Windows-and-Debian-Vulnerabilities-exploitation-with-metasploit
The project involved conducting targeted vulnerability assessments on both Windows and Debian systems, followed by exploiting identified vulnerabilities using the Metasploit Framework. Through systematic penetration testing, critical security weaknesses were identified and leveraged to simulate real-world cyber threats. This comprehensive approach enabled the team to gain valuable insights into system vulnerabilities and develop proactive defense strategies to mitigate potential risks.
